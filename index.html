                    <!-- === 修改以下个人简介 === -->
                    <p>I am an economist with research interests in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My research agenda focuses on the economics of the family and gender-based violence. I am passionate about combining economic theory with empirical analysis to understand the incentives behind household behavior and the effects of family, gender, and crime on individual labor market outcomes. My work involves both structural form and reduced form analysis.</p>
